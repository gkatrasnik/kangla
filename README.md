# Kangla

Kangla is a plant care app designed as a hobby project. Users can upload photos of plants, and the app identifies them, adding them to a personal collection with basic information and recommended watering intervals. Users can log watering events, and Kangla will notify them when itâ€™s time to water their plants again, making plant care simple and enjoyable.
